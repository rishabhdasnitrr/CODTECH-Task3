Students can explore, purchase, and track their progress within each course, making learning easy and accessible. 

## Features

- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login functionality for students and instructors.
- **Course Catalog**: Browse and filter through a wide selection of courses across multiple categories.
- **Course Purchase**: Students can securely purchase courses using PayPal.
- **Progress Tracking**: Students can mark their progress for each course and see their overall completion.
- **Instructor Dashboard**: Instructors can create courses, upload videos, and view their students.
- **Responsive Design**: The platform is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across devices.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Redux for state management, Tailwind CSS and Shad CN UI for styling.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js for API development, MongoDB for database.
